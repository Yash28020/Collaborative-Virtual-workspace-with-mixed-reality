3D CollaborativePlace is an immersive virtual workplace platform that leverages Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate real-time collaboration among distributed teams in a shared 3D environment. Designed for remote and hybrid work settings, the platform merges spatial computing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and web-based 3D environments to simulate a realistic office or project space.

🚀 Features
Shared 3D Virtual Workspace: Persistent and interactive 3D environments where users can meet, work, and collaborate.

Mixed Reality Integration: Compatible with MR headsets (e.g., HoloLens, Meta Quest with passthrough) and traditional devices.

Avatar-Based Interaction: Users are represented by customizable avatars with lip-sync, gestures, and basic expressions.

Spatial Audio & Communication: Realistic 3D audio enhances the feeling of co-presence and spatial awareness.

Object Manipulation: Collaboratively move, annotate, and interact with virtual objects or 3D data models.

Real-Time Collaboration Tools:

Whiteboards

File sharing

Live screen casting

Task/project boards (Trello-like)

WebXR/WebGL Support: Accessible via modern web browsers and VR platforms without installations.

Multi-Platform Support: Works on desktop, mobile, and MR/VR headsets.

Backend Integration: Real-time database and authentication using Firebase or a custom backend (Node.js + WebSockets).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Three.js / Babylon.js / A-Frame for 3D rendering

WebXR / WebAR for immersive access

Backend: Node.js, WebSocket, Firebase (or custom database)

Authentication: Firebase Auth / OAuth

Voice & Video: WebRTC or third-party services like Agora or Daily

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / Docker-based deployment for scalable environments

🔧 Use Cases
Remote team meetings and brainstorming

Virtual co-working spaces

Collaborative design and prototyping

Education, training, and simulations

Client presentations in 3D spaces
